		<p>Meet 6-year-old Sally Teo, who lives with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkitt%27s_lymphoma">Burkitt's Lymphoma</a></strong>. Sally is a bright and bubbly girl who enjoys drawing and baking! She also loves fairytales and stories of folklore, especially Santa Claus! Referred to the organisation by her parents who wanted to give her a very special and unforgettable Santa-themed birthday, our head volunteer Tom gathered a group of our volunteers together to produce a very special celebration for Sally.</p>
		<p>Paper sculptors,  painting session, toy-making sessions and even a bouncy castle was available at Sally's birthday party held at Suntec City on the 10th of November 2015! Of course, the role of Santa Claus was given to Sally as she painted and gave out her drawings to everyone who attended!</p>
		<p>All these were made possible with the financial aid from our donators, the sponsors and last but not least our very own volunteers! We at Make-A-Wish Foundation Singapore would like to thank everyone that is involved in making Sally's wish come true!</p>
